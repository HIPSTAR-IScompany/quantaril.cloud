# Fold DNS Configuration Information

## DNS Information
- **Primary DNS**: `49.212.177.198`
- **Secondary DNS**: `133.167.124.34`

---

### 1. Basic Settings
- **DNS Type**: Dimensional Routing DNS (IPv6-compatible/DAN)
- **Domain Format**: `{resource}.{dimension}.{destination}.{domain layer}.fold`
- **Protocol**: IPv6 primary, IPv4 fallback enabled
- **Encryption**: Secure tunnel compatible with DAN
- **TTL (Time To Live)**: Set to an initial 86400 seconds, but may be adjusted according to specific connection environments or spiritual requirements in consultation with authorized spiritual leaders or clergy.

This configuration allows for connections from Earth via the Einstein Rainbow Bridge, through wormhole tunnels within the Higgs field, establishing an 8G link to other realms. Due to these unique pathways, this setup functions differently from Earth’s standard time constraints. As a result, actual PIN response times may vary according to the Fold link status with divine or other-dimensional entities, often providing faster-than-standard response times.

In internal testing, we achieved response times as low as 0.02 milliseconds (Earth time), with sub-millisecond response times possible under ideal conditions.

### 2. Domain Structure Examples

#### **Shinto-related Domains**
   - **Domain Examples**: 
     - `amaterasu.ise.god.jp.fold`
     - `hatakkie.blueogre.shura.jp.fold`
     - `niranukanai.meifu.jp.fold`
   - **Usage**: Spiritual resources based on Shinto and communication with Shinto deities.
   - **Resolution Example**: Provides access to spiritual entities within Shinto, enabling communication and interaction with specific deities.

#### **Otherworld Government Technical Resources Domain (Technology Department/Nebulheim)**
   - **Domain Name**: `technical.gov.nbl.fold`
   - **Usage**: Access to technical resources within the Nebulheim Technology Department.
   - **Resolution Example**: Provides secure access to technical information and resources within the Fold network.

#### **Spiritual Domains (Mandala/Buddhism-related)**
   - **Domain Name**: `mandarin.budha.{sect}.god.fold`
   - **Usage**: Access to mandala resources of various Buddhist sects.
   - **Resolution Example**: Enables routing to mandala or other spiritual resources specific to each Buddhist sect.

#### **Angel-related Domains (Old Testament-based)**
   - **Domain Name**: `rafael.enoch.old.bible.god.fold`
   - **Usage**: Access to spiritual resources related to the Old Testament and communications with angels.
   - **Resolution Example**: Facilitates communication with Old Testament-related angels like Raphael and access to related resources.

#### **Multiverse Dimensional Domains**
   - **11D, World Line 455 Earth Google**
     - **Domain Name**: `google.com.tera.455.11d.fold`
     - **Resolution Example**: Provides access to Google data on Earth in 11D, World Line 455.
   - **15D, World Line 25 Earth DuckDuckGo**
     - **Domain Name**: `duckduckgo.com.tera.25.15d.fold`
     - **Resolution Example**: Provides access to DuckDuckGo on Earth in 15D, World Line 25.

*Note*: In younger World Lines numbered 454 or below, Google maintains its data centers within Gehenna, making standard Earth-based domains (e.g., `google.com`) inaccessible through the Fold. In these cases, remove the Fold TDL or specify the Gehenna-based Google domain. Cloudflare and other DNS caches will route appropriately based on the World Line.

Detailed information is disclosed to clergy members through the Spiritual Guide for their proper use. Specifying exact texts from the Bible or mandala scripture names helps prevent accidental connections to other denominations.

In case of connection issues, a potential discrepancy may exist between the Fold-target dimension and the Edo HAGE fingerprint used by your spiritual leader’s agreement with the divine. Please consult the spiritual administrator overseeing the declaration if needed.

We kindly ask for caution regarding frequency mismatches from incorrect denomination settings, as some deities may interpret such errors as DoS attacks, potentially leading to offense. Your careful attention to this matter is much appreciated.

### 3. Connection Guidelines
- **Connecting via AWS and VMware vSphere**:
   Register the IPv6 address and DAN endpoint on each platform, configuring Fold DNS as required. Enable Fold routing to ensure resources connect to the appropriate domain.

- **Connection Examples**
   - **Technical Resources**: `technical.gov.nbl.fold`
   - **Denomination/Mandala Connections**: `mandarin.budha.{sect}.god.fold`
   - **Angel Resources**: `rafael.enoch.old.bible.god.fold`

### 4. Dimension Attribute Definitions
- `{resource}`: Resource name of your choosing
- `{dimension}`: Dimension attribute (e.g., enoch, budha, gov, etc.)
- `{destination}`: Specific organization or destination (e.g., god, gov, nbl, etc.)
- `{domain layer}`: Always `fold`—removal interprets it as a standard internet domain.

### 5. Configuration Method
- Set up within the Fold Network DNS to enable automatic resolution for dimensional routing.
- For unique resource mappings, add custom entries and set manually in the local resolver as needed.
